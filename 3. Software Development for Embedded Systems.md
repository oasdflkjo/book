# Software Development for Embedded Systems

Software development in embedded systems requires a disciplined approach to ensure code quality, maintainability, and efficient collaboration among teams. This chapter covers essential practices like version control, development workflows, continuous integration, and testing strategies that are critical for modern embedded development.

## Version Control (Git) and PR Workflows

**Version control** is a fundamental practice in modern software development, and **Git** is the most widely used version control system. Git helps manage changes to source code, allowing teams to collaborate efficiently while maintaining a history of changes.

### Git Basics
- **Repository**: A Git repository stores the entire project and its history.
- **Commits**: Snapshots of changes made to the code. A meaningful commit message explains what changes were made and why.
- **Branches**: A branch represents an independent line of development. Use feature branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

### Pull Request (PR) Workflow
A **pull request (PR)** workflow is a development practice where changes made in a feature branch are proposed for merging into the main branch. PRs allow for peer review, automated testing, and discussions before the code is integrated.

#### Steps in a PR Workflow:
1. **Create a Branch**: Developers create a branch for each new feature or bug fix.
2. **Work on the Feature**: Code is written, tested, and committed to the branch.
3. **Open a Pull Request**: Once the feature is complete, the developer opens a PR, asking to merge the branch into the main branch.
4. **Code Review**: Other team members review the PR, ensuring that the code follows best practices and doesn't introduce bugs.
5. **Merge**: Once approved, the code is merged into the main branch.

#### Benefits of PR Workflow:
- **Peer Review**: Ensures that multiple developers review the code before itâ€™s merged.
- **Testing Integration**: CI pipelines can be triggered automatically to validate the changes.
- **Collaboration**: The PR system encourages open discussions about the code and proposed changes.

## Basic Embedded Programming Concepts

Embedded programming involves writing software that interacts directly with hardware. The focus is on optimizing for performance, memory usage, and power consumption while dealing with real-time constraints.

### Key Concepts:
- **Memory Management**: Embedded systems often have limited memory, so efficient use of RAM and flash is critical. Avoid dynamic memory allocation when possible.
- **Real-time Constraints**: Many embedded systems need to meet strict timing requirements (e.g., handling sensor data in real time).
- **Interrupts**: Embedded systems frequently use hardware interrupts to respond to external events quickly. Writing efficient Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) is crucial.
- **Peripheral Management**: Embedded programming typically involves interacting with peripherals like GPIOs, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, and PWM. Efficiently managing these peripherals is essential.
- **Low-power Design**: Embedded systems often run on limited power, requiring developers to implement power-saving techniques like sleep modes and clock scaling.

### Development in C/C++
Most embedded systems are programmed in **C** or **C++**. STM32 development typically involves using low-level libraries (like **CMSIS** and **HAL**) to interact with hardware, while application code is written in a modular and efficient way.

## Conclusion

Software development for embedded systems requires a disciplined approach to ensure that code is maintainable, efficient, and free of critical bugs. Using Git for version control and employing PR workflows helps streamline the development process while ensuring high-quality code. By following these practices, developers can deliver robust and scalable embedded systems.
