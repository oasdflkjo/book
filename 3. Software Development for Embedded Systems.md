# Chapter 3: Software Development for Embedded Systems

Software development in embedded systems requires a disciplined approach to ensure code quality, maintainability, and efficient collaboration among teams. This chapter covers essential practices like version control, development workflows, continuous integration, and testing strategies that are critical for modern embedded development.

## 3.1 Version Control (Git) and PR Workflows

**Version control** is a fundamental practice in modern software development, and **Git** is the most widely used version control system. Git helps manage changes to source code, allowing teams to collaborate efficiently while maintaining a history of changes.

### Git Basics
- **Repository**: A Git repository stores the entire project and its history.
- **Commits**: Snapshots of changes made to the code. A meaningful commit message explains what changes were made and why.
- **Branches**: A branch represents an independent line of development. Use feature branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

### Pull Request (PR) Workflow
A **pull request (PR)** workflow is a development practice where changes made in a feature branch are proposed for merging into the main branch. PRs allow for peer review, automated testing, and discussions before the code is integrated.

#### Steps in a PR Workflow:
1. **Create a Branch**: Developers create a branch for each new feature or bug fix.
2. **Work on the Feature**: Code is written, tested, and committed to the branch.
3. **Open a Pull Request**: Once the feature is complete, the developer opens a PR, asking to merge the branch into the main branch.
4. **Code Review**: Other team members review the PR, ensuring that the code follows best practices and doesn't introduce bugs.
5. **Merge**: Once approved, the code is merged into the main branch.

#### Benefits of PR Workflow:
- **Peer Review**: Ensures that multiple developers review the code before itâ€™s merged.
- **Testing Integration**: CI pipelines can be triggered automatically to validate the changes.
- **Collaboration**: The PR system encourages open discussions about the code and proposed changes.

## 3.2 Basic Embedded Programming Concepts

Embedded programming involves writing software that interacts directly with hardware. The focus is on optimizing for performance, memory usage, and power consumption while dealing with real-time constraints.

### Key Concepts:
- **Memory Management**: Embedded systems often have limited memory, so efficient use of RAM and flash is critical. Avoid dynamic memory allocation when possible.
- **Real-time Constraints**: Many embedded systems need to meet strict timing requirements (e.g., handling sensor data in real time).
- **Interrupts**: Embedded systems frequently use hardware interrupts to respond to external events quickly. Writing efficient Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) is crucial.
- **Peripheral Management**: Embedded programming typically involves interacting with peripherals like GPIOs, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, and PWM. Efficiently managing these peripherals is essential.
- **Low-power Design**: Embedded systems often run on limited power, requiring developers to implement power-saving techniques like sleep modes and clock scaling.

### Development in C/C++
Most embedded systems are programmed in **C** or **C++**. STM32 development typically involves using low-level libraries (like **CMSIS** and **HAL**) to interact with hardware, while application code is written in a modular and efficient way.

## 3.3 Development Workflows and CI/CD Pipelines

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are modern development practices used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software. In embedded systems, CI/CD pipelines ensure that code changes are automatically tested and validated, reducing the likelihood of bugs and regression.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
CI involves automating the build and test process for every code change pushed to the repository. A typical CI pipeline for embedded systems includes:
- **Automated Builds**: Code is automatically compiled for the target hardware platform using cross-compilers.
- **Unit Tests**: Automated tests verify that individual components of the software behave as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: These tests ensure that the system works correctly when different modules are integrated.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Tools like **Cppcheck** or **Clang-Tidy** can be used to analyze the code for potential bugs or style violations before it is compiled.

#### Benefits of CI:
- **Early Bug Detection**: Automated testing catches issues before they reach production.
- **Faster Feedback**: Developers are notified of build failures or test failures shortly after making a change.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated testing and analysis improve the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
CD automates the deployment of embedded software to test environments or even production systems. In embedded systems, CD might involve:
- **Deploying Firmware**: Once the code passes all tests, firmware images can be automatically generated and deployed to hardware devices for real-world testing.
- **HIL Testing Integration**: Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems can be used to verify that the firmware interacts correctly with real-world inputs and outputs.

#### Benefits of CD:
- **Faster Releases**: Automating the deployment process speeds up the release of new features and bug fixes.
- **Consistent Deployments**: Automated processes ensure that the deployment is consistent and reduces the risk of human error.

## 3.4 Unit Tests, Linting, and Static Analysis

To ensure that embedded software is reliable and maintainable, it's essential to use **unit tests**, **linting**, and **static analysis** tools. These tools help prevent bugs, enforce coding standards, and ensure that the software is functioning as intended.

### Unit Testing in Embedded Systems
Unit testing involves testing individual components (or "units") of the software to verify that they behave correctly in isolation. In embedded systems, unit tests help verify the behavior of functions or modules without needing to run the code on actual hardware.

- **Test Frameworks**: Tools like **CppUTest** and **Unity** are commonly used for writing unit tests in C/C++.
- **Mocking Peripherals**: Because embedded software interacts with hardware, mocks and fakes are used to simulate peripheral behavior in unit tests.
- **Automated Tests in CI**: Unit tests can be integrated into the CI pipeline to automatically validate the code after every change.

### Linting and Static Code Analysis
**Linting** tools help ensure that the code follows coding standards and best practices, while **static analysis** tools analyze the code for potential issues before it is run.

#### Common Tools:
- **Cppcheck**: A static analysis tool for C/C++ that detects memory leaks, null pointer dereferences, and other common issues.
- **Clang-Tidy**: A linter and static analysis tool that checks for coding style violations and potential bugs.
- **PC-Lint**: Another popular linting tool for embedded development.

#### Benefits of Linting and Static Analysis:
- **Code Consistency**: Enforcing consistent coding standards across the codebase improves maintainability.
- **Early Bug Detection**: Static analysis tools detect issues like memory leaks or buffer overflows early in the development process.
- **Automated Checks**: These tools can be integrated into CI pipelines to ensure that code is linted and analyzed for potential bugs before being merged into the main branch.

## Conclusion

Software development for embedded systems requires a disciplined approach to ensure that code is maintainable, efficient, and free of critical bugs. Using Git for version control, employing PR workflows, and integrating CI/CD pipelines with automated testing helps streamline the development process while ensuring high-quality code. Unit testing, linting, and static analysis further ensure that the software is reliable and meets industry standards. By following these practices, developers can deliver robust and scalable embedded systems.
