# Build Systems for Embedded Projects

> **Warning**: This chapter covers advanced topics on build systems. While it may seem complex at first, it is essential to understand these tools early on to grasp the flow of the book. Skipping this section may lead to gaps in understanding future topics, so it’s highly recommended to engage with the content.

Building embedded systems requires the right set of tools to ensure efficiency, portability, and maintainability. The choice of a build system and toolchain significantly impacts the scalability of your project, especially when working in larger teams or managing continuous integration pipelines.

In this chapter, we will cover modern build systems such as **CMake** and **Ninja**. We'll also introduce **Meson** as an alternative to CMake, discuss the integration of these systems with the **ARM Embedded Toolchain**, and explain why tools like **Keil** and **STM32CubeMX** should be avoided after project initialization.

## Why Keil and STM32CubeMX Should Be Avoided

While **Keil** and **STM32CubeMX** are popular tools for embedded development, they introduce several challenges that can hinder project scalability, maintainability, and automation.

### Keil: Vendor Lock-in and Hard-to-Maintain Project Files
**Keil** is an IDE and toolchain provided by Arm, often recommended for ARM-based microcontroller development. However, it suffers from several drawbacks:
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Projects developed with Keil are often tightly coupled to the toolchain, making it difficult to switch to other build systems or compilers. This vendor lock-in can limit flexibility and portability.
- **Complex Project Files**: Keil generates proprietary project files that are not easy to maintain, especially in large teams. Merging changes across multiple developers can be a challenge, and the lack of transparency in the project structure makes it harder to troubleshoot.
- **Limited CI/CD Integration**: Keil's graphical user interface makes it harder to integrate with command-line-driven CI/CD pipelines. Command-line tools like CMake and Ninja, on the other hand, allow seamless integration with CI tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

### STM32CubeMX: Autogenerated Code that is Hard to Read
**STM32CubeMX** is a graphical tool provided by STMicroelectronics to help initialize STM32 microcontroller projects. While it simplifies project setup, it introduces several issues:
- **Hard-to-Read Code**: CubeMX generates a significant amount of boilerplate code, often with excessive comments and layers of abstraction that make it difficult to follow or debug. This autogenerated code can obscure the underlying hardware logic and make it harder to maintain.
- **Limited Customization**: While CubeMX simplifies initialization, it can be challenging to modify the generated code for more complex or custom use cases. This limits the flexibility of your project, especially as it scales.

## CMake and Ninja: Fast and Scalable Builds

### CMake
**CMake** is a cross-platform build system generator that helps manage the build process in a compiler-independent manner. It has gained widespread popularity in embedded systems due to its flexibility, ease of use, and ability to generate project files for various platforms and IDEs.

#### Why Use CMake:
- **Portability**: CMake allows developers to write a single build configuration that can target different platforms (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Flexibility**: It supports a wide variety of compilers and toolchains, making it ideal for embedded development.
- **Integration with IDEs**: CMake can generate project files for IDEs like Visual Studio, CLion, and Eclipse, streamlining the development process for those who prefer graphical tools.

### Ninja
**Ninja** is a small, focused build system designed to run builds as fast as possible. Unlike traditional makefiles, Ninja is designed for speed and excels at parallel builds.

#### Why Use Ninja:
- **Speed**: Ninja is known for its extremely fast build times, particularly in projects with a large number of files, thanks to its efficient use of parallelism.
- **CMake Compatibility**: Ninja can be easily used as a backend to CMake, providing a fast build system that can be used alongside CMake's powerful configuration capabilities.

## Meson: An Alternative to CMake

**Meson** is another modern build system that has been gaining traction, particularly for its simplicity and speed. Unlike CMake, Meson uses the **Ninja** backend by default, making it faster and more streamlined for developers who need a fast and easy-to-use build system.

#### Why Use Meson:
- **Ease of Use**: Meson's syntax is simpler compared to CMake, which reduces the learning curve for new developers and makes it easier to maintain build scripts.
- **Speed**: Since Meson uses Ninja as its default backend, it benefits from Ninja’s fast parallel builds out of the box.
- **Modern Features**: Meson offers built-in support for modern features like unit testing, cross-compilation, and custom toolchains, making it an appealing alternative for embedded projects.

### Comparison: CMake vs. Meson

| Feature | CMake | Meson |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Ease of Use** | Steeper learning curve, more verbose | Simpler, more readable syntax |
| **Speed** | Depends on the generator (Ninja or Make) | Very fast, uses Ninja by default |
| **Cross-Compilation** | Supports a wide range of platforms | Excellent support, easy configuration |
| **IDE Integration** | Strong integration with various IDEs | Limited IDE support |
| **Configurability** | Extremely flexible but can be complex | Less flexible but simpler to manage |
| **Community and Ecosystem** | Large, well-established community | Growing, but smaller compared to CMake |

Table: Comparison between CMake and Meson build systems.

Both CMake and Meson are excellent choices depending on the project requirements. If your project demands high flexibility, supports multiple platforms and toolchains, and requires integration with an IDE, CMake is likely the better option. On the other hand, if simplicity and speed are your priorities, Meson is worth considering, especially for performance-critical embedded projects.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right build system is a critical decision for any embedded project. The build system directly impacts not only how fast and efficiently your code compiles, but also how easy it is to maintain and scale your project. Tools like CMake, Ninja, and Meson all have their strengths and trade-offs, so carefully evaluate your project's needs when selecting one.
