# Build Systems for Embedded Projects

The process of building embedded systems requires the right set of tools to ensure efficiency, portability, and maintainability. The choice of build systems and toolchains has a significant impact on the project's scalability, especially when working with larger teams or continuous integration pipelines. In this chapter, we will discuss modern build systems such as **CMake** and **Ninja**, their integration with the **ARM Embedded Toolchain**, and why tools like **Keil** and **STM32CubeMX** should be avoided after project initialization.

## CMake and Ninja: Fast and Scalable Builds

### CMake
**CMake** is a cross-platform build system generator that helps manage the build process in a compiler-independent manner. It is widely used in embedded systems due to its flexibility and ability to generate project files for various environments.

#### Why Use CMake:
- **Portability**: CMake allows developers to write a single build configuration that can be used across multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- **Extensibility**: It can easily handle complex project structures and integrate external libraries or dependencies.
- **Easy to Maintain**: CMake uses text-based configuration files (CMakeLists.txt), which are easier to maintain and review compared to IDE-based project configurations.
- **Containerization**: CMake works seamlessly within Docker containers, enabling a fully portable build environment for all developers without requiring complex toolchain setup.

### Ninja
**Ninja** is a small, fast build system often used as a backend for CMake. Ninja focuses on speed, particularly in incremental builds, making it ideal for large embedded projects that require frequent builds.

#### Why Use Ninja:
- **Speed**: Ninja is designed to build projects as quickly as possible, outperforming traditional build systems like `make` in many cases.
- **Parallelization**: Ninja excels at parallel builds, leveraging all available CPU cores to reduce build times.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Ninja's speed and simplicity make it a natural fit for continuous integration pipelines, where fast feedback is critical.

### ARM Embedded Toolchain
The **ARM Embedded Toolchain** is a suite of compilers, linkers, and utilities designed for cross-compiling code to run on ARM-based microcontrollers. The toolchain provides a complete solution for building embedded applications, and it works well with command-line tools like CMake and Ninja.

#### Why Use the ARM Toolchain:
- **Cross-compilation**: The toolchain is optimized for embedded ARM targets, ensuring efficient code generation.
- **Flexibility**: The ARM toolchain can be easily integrated into different build systems, whether you're using CMake, Makefiles, or custom scripts.
- **Containerization**: The ARM toolchain is commonly used in Docker containers, allowing you to create a fully portable and reproducible development environment for your team.

## Why Keil and STM32CubeMX Should Be Avoided

While **Keil** and **STM32CubeMX** are popular tools for embedded development, they introduce several challenges that can hinder project scalability, maintainability, and automation.

### Keil: Vendor Lock-in and Hard-to-Maintain Project Files
**Keil** is an IDE and toolchain provided by Arm, often recommended for ARM-based microcontroller development. However, it suffers from several drawbacks:
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Projects developed with Keil are often tightly coupled to the toolchain, making it difficult to switch to other build systems or compilers. This vendor lock-in can limit flexibility and portability.
- **Complex Project Files**: Keil generates proprietary project files that are not easy to maintain, especially in large teams. Merging changes across multiple developers can be a challenge, and the lack of transparency in the project structure makes it harder to troubleshoot.
- **Limited CI/CD Integration**: Keil's graphical user interface makes it harder to integrate with command-line-driven CI/CD pipelines. Command-line tools like CMake and Ninja, on the other hand, allow seamless integration with CI tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

### STM32CubeMX: Autogenerated Code that is Hard to Read
**STM32CubeMX** is a graphical tool provided by STMicroelectronics to help initialize STM32 microcontroller projects. While it simplifies project setup, it introduces several issues:
- **Hard-to-Read Code**: CubeMX generates a significant amount of boilerplate code, often with excessive comments and layers of abstraction that make it difficult to follow or debug. This autogenerated code can obscure the underlying hardware logic and make it harder to maintain.
- **Limited Customization**: While CubeMX simplifies initialization, it can be challenging to modify the generated code for more complex or custom use cases. This limits the flexibility of your project, especially as it scales.

## Best Practices for Building Embedded Projects

### Command-Line Tooling
For modern embedded projects, itâ€™s important to move away from IDE-based tools like Keil and CubeMX after initial project setup. Using command-line tooling like **CMake** and **Ninja** helps maintain portability and scalability while making it easier to automate builds in CI/CD pipelines.

#### Benefits of Command-Line Tooling:
- **CI/CD Integration**: Command-line tools are easily integrated into continuous integration and delivery pipelines, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Portability**: Developers can build the project on any platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) without needing to install specific IDEs or toolchains.
- **Speed**: Tools like Ninja offer faster build times compared to IDEs, improving developer productivity, especially during iterative development cycles.

### Containerization for Build Environments
By containerizing your build environment using Docker, you can ensure that every developer on the team has the exact same environment, avoiding issues related to different local setups. A typical Docker container would include:
- **ARM Embedded Toolchain**: To ensure consistent cross-compilation.
- **CMake and Ninja**: For managing the build process and ensuring fast, incremental builds.
- **Unit Testing Frameworks**: To automate testing as part of the build pipeline.

## Conclusion

Building embedded systems with tools like **CMake**, **Ninja**, and the **ARM Embedded Toolchain** offers flexibility, speed, and maintainability. Moving away from IDE-specific tools like **Keil** and **STM32CubeMX** after project initialization ensures that your build process is portable and scalable, enabling better integration with CI/CD pipelines. By embracing command-line tools and containerized environments, you can streamline the development process and ensure that every developer on the team can build and test projects quickly and consistently.
