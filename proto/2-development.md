# Chapter: Software Development for Embedded Systems

In embedded systems development, ensuring code quality, managing version control, and automating the build and deployment process are crucial to building reliable products. This chapter focuses on modern software development practices, particularly version control with Git and pull request (PR) workflows. For detailed information on testing, CI/CD pipelines, and code quality tools, please refer to the dedicated testing chapter.

## 1. Version Control with Git

**Git** is the most commonly used version control system (VCS) in modern software development. It allows teams to track code changes, collaborate efficiently, and manage versions of software projects. In embedded systems, where hardware and software evolve together, Git provides a stable platform for managing firmware updates, bug fixes, and feature development.

### Key Concepts:
- **Repository**: A Git repository contains all the project files and history of changes.
- **Commits**: A commit represents a snapshot of the code at a specific point in time.
- **Branches**: Branches allow you to work on new features or fixes in isolation, without affecting the main codebase.
- **Merge**: Once work on a branch is complete, it can be merged into the main codebase.

### Best Practices for Git:
- **Frequent Commits**: Commit code frequently to keep track of small, manageable changes.
- **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Use meaningful messages to describe what each commit does.
- **Branching Strategy**: Use a structured branching strategy (e.g., **Git Flow** or **feature branching**) to manage parallel development efforts.

## 2. Pull Request (PR) Workflow

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a development workflow that allows developers to propose changes to the main codebase while ensuring that the changes are reviewed, tested, and approved before integration. PR-based development encourages collaboration and code review.

### Steps in a PR Workflow:
1. **Create a Feature Branch**: Developers create a new branch for each feature, bug fix, or enhancement.
2. **Develop and Test**: Code is written, unit tests are added, and initial testing is performed locally.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: When the work is ready, a PR is opened, proposing the changes to the main branch.
4. **Code Review**: Other developers review the code, ensuring it meets the project's standards.
5. **Merge**: Once approved and verified through testing, the PR is merged into the main codebase.

### Advantages of PR Workflow:
- **Code Review**: Peer review ensures high-quality code and catches potential issues early.
- **Transparency**: All changes are visible and can be discussed before integration.
- **Testing**: Automated tests and CI pipelines can be triggered automatically to verify changes.

## 3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying embedded software. While this topic is covered in-depth in the testing chapter, it's important to note that integrating CI/CD into your development workflow ensures that code changes are continuously tested and validated, preventing regressions and reducing the time to release.

For detailed information on CI/CD pipelines, unit testing, linting, and integrating these practices into your embedded systems development workflow, please refer to the dedicated testing chapter.

## 4. Conclusion

Integrating modern software development practices like Git and PR-based workflows is crucial in ensuring the success of embedded systems projects. These practices provide a framework for collaboration, code quality, and continuous improvement, leading to more stable and reliable embedded systems. The next chapter will delve deeper into testing methodologies, CI/CD pipelines, and code quality tools specific to embedded systems development.
