# Real-time Operating Systems (RTOS)

Real-time operating systems (RTOS) are crucial in embedded systems where tasks must be completed within specific time constraints. An RTOS allows for the efficient management of multiple tasks by providing a scheduling mechanism that ensures real-time tasks are executed on time. This chapter explores the core concepts of real-time systems, the FreeRTOS platform, task management, and communication between tasks.

## Concepts of Real-time Systems and Scheduling

### What is a Real-time System?

A **real-time system** is an embedded system where the correctness of the operation depends not only on the logical result of the computation but also on the time at which the results are produced. These systems are designed to complete tasks within a specific time frame, ensuring that critical operations are performed on time.

### Hard vs. Soft Real-time Systems
- **Hard Real-time Systems**: These systems have strict timing constraints, and failure to meet deadlines can result in catastrophic failures. Examples include automotive safety systems, medical devices, and industrial control systems.
- **Soft Real-time Systems**: These systems have more lenient timing constraints, where missing a deadline may degrade performance but does not result in complete failure. Examples include multimedia applications and user interfaces.

### RTOS Scheduling

An RTOS uses scheduling algorithms to manage how tasks are executed. Common scheduling mechanisms include:

- **Preemptive Scheduling**: A higher-priority task can preempt (interrupt) a lower-priority task, ensuring that critical tasks are executed first.
- **Round-robin Scheduling**: Tasks are executed in a rotating order, where each task gets a fair share of CPU time. This is typically used for tasks with the same priority level.
- **Preemptive Priority-based Round-robin Scheduling**: Many RTOS systems, including FreeRTOS, use a combination of preemptive and round-robin approaches. In this model, higher-priority tasks can preempt lower-priority ones, while tasks of the same priority are scheduled in a round-robin fashion.

This combined approach provides a balance between ensuring critical tasks are executed promptly and maintaining fairness among tasks of equal priority.

#### Task States in RTOS:
- **Running**: The task is currently being executed by the CPU.
- **Ready**: The task is ready to be executed but is waiting for CPU time.
- **Blocked**: The task is waiting for an event, such as an I/O operation or a timer, to complete.
- **Suspended**: The task is inactive and will not be scheduled until it is resumed.

## FreeRTOS and Task Management

**FreeRTOS** is one of the most widely used real-time operating systems for embedded systems. It is open-source, lightweight, and highly configurable, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. FreeRTOS provides the necessary tools to manage tasks, scheduling, and communication between tasks in real-time systems.

### Creating and Managing Tasks in FreeRTOS

A **task** is a basic unit of execution in FreeRTOS. Each task is created to run a specific function and is assigned a priority.

#### Example of Creating a Task:

```c
xTaskCreate(
    TaskFunction,    /* Pointer to the task function */
    "TaskName",      /* Task name */
    StackSize,       /* Stack size in words */
    Parameters,      /* Parameters to pass to the task */
    Priority,        /* Task priority */
    &TaskHandle      /* Handle for the task (optional) */
);
```

- **TaskFunction**: A function that will be executed as a task.
- **Priority**: Tasks with higher priorities will preempt lower-priority tasks.
- **TaskHandle**: Optional handle to reference the task for later operations like suspending or deleting the task.

### Task Scheduling in FreeRTOS
FreeRTOS uses **preemptive scheduling** by default, meaning that tasks with higher priorities can interrupt lower-priority tasks. Additionally, tasks with the same priority level are scheduled in a **round-robin** fashion, where each task gets a turn to execute for a specific amount of time (time-slicing).

### Task Delays and Timing
Tasks can be delayed or set to execute after a specified time using functions like `vTaskDelay()`, which allows tasks to yield the CPU to other tasks during idle periods or waiting for a specific time to elapse.

## Communication Between Tasks and Interrupt Handling

In real-time systems, tasks often need to communicate with each other or respond to interrupts generated by hardware peripherals. FreeRTOS provides mechanisms for **inter-task communication** and safely managing **interrupt service routines (ISRs)**.

### Inter-task Communication

FreeRTOS provides multiple methods for communication and synchronization between tasks, including:

- **Queues**: Allow tasks to send and receive data in a thread-safe manner. Queues are often used to pass messages between producer tasks (which generate data) and consumer tasks (which process the data).
  
- **Semaphores**: Used to synchronize tasks or protect shared resources. Semaphores ensure that only one task accesses a shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions.

- **Task Notifications**: A lightweight method for one task to notify another task of an event. Task notifications are faster and use fewer resources than queues or semaphores.

#### Example of Using Queues in FreeRTOS:

```c
xQueueHandle xQueue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(int));

void vSenderTask(void *pvParameters) {
    int dataToSend = 42;
    xQueueSend(xQueue, &dataToSend, 0);
}

void vReceiverTask(void *pvParameters) {
    int receivedData;
    if (xQueueReceive(xQueue, &receivedData, portMAX_DELAY)) {
        /* Process received data */
    }
}
```

### Interrupt Handling in FreeRTOS

**Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)** are critical in real-time systems, as they allow the microcontroller to respond quickly to external events. FreeRTOS provides mechanisms to handle interrupts efficiently without disrupting the real-time scheduling of tasks.

#### Guidelines for Writing ISRs in FreeRTOS:
- **Minimize ISR Length**: Keep ISRs short and efficient, delegating longer processing to tasks.
- **Use Task Notifications**: ISRs can use task notifications to signal tasks when an interrupt occurs, allowing the task to handle the event after the ISR completes.
- **Critical Sections**: If an ISR and a task share resources, use **critical sections** to prevent race conditions and data corruption.

#### Example of an ISR Triggering a Task Notification:

```c
void vISR_Handler(void) {
    BaseType_t xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;
    vTaskNotifyGiveFromISR(xTaskHandle, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken);
    portYIELD_FROM_ISR(xHigherPriorityTaskWoken);
}
```

This allows the ISR to notify the task that it needs to handle a specific event, such as reading data from a sensor or responding to a communication interrupt.
