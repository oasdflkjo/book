# Chapter: Understanding Microcontroller Interrupts

Interrupts are a fundamental concept in embedded systems, enabling microcontrollers to respond quickly to external events. Instead of continuously polling for changes, interrupts allow the system to react immediately to high-priority events, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness. In this chapter, we’ll explore what interrupts are, how they work, and how they are used in microcontroller systems.

## 1. What are Interrupts?

An **interrupt** is a signal that temporarily halts the normal execution of a program so that the microcontroller can respond to an event. Once the event has been handled, the microcontroller resumes its previous task. Interrupts are crucial for handling time-sensitive tasks or events that occur asynchronously.

### Key Characteristics of Interrupts:
- **Asynchronous**: Interrupts can occur at any time, triggered by external or internal events.
- **Non-blocking**: The microcontroller does not need to constantly check (poll) for an event; it will be automatically interrupted when the event occurs.
- **High Priority**: Interrupts can have different priority levels, allowing the microcontroller to respond to the most critical events first.

## 2. Types of Interrupts

Microcontrollers typically support two main types of interrupts:

### 2.1 External Interrupts
**External interrupts** are triggered by events that occur outside the microcontroller, such as a button press, a sensor signal, or a communication event (e.g., receiving data via UART or SPI). These are crucial for systems that interact with the physical world.

Examples of external interrupts include:
- A pushbutton connected to a GPIO pin that generates an interrupt when pressed.
- An external sensor providing a signal to trigger data collection.

### 2.2 Internal Interrupts
**Internal interrupts** are generated by internal peripherals or the microcontroller’s core itself. These include events like timers overflowing, communication peripherals completing data transfers, or analog-to-digital converters (ADC) finishing a conversion.

Examples of internal interrupts include:
- A timer interrupt used to trigger regular periodic tasks.
- A UART interrupt that signals the completion of data transmission or reception.

## 3. How Interrupts Work

When an interrupt occurs, the microcontroller’s current execution is suspended, and it jumps to a special function called an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** or **Interrupt Handler**. This function handles the event that triggered the interrupt. After the ISR completes, the microcontroller resumes execution from where it left off.

### Interrupt Process:
1. **Event Occurs**: An external or internal event triggers the interrupt.
2. **Context Saving**: The microcontroller saves its current state (registers and program counter) to return to the same point later.
3. **ISR Execution**: The microcontroller jumps to the ISR to handle the interrupt.
4. **Context Restoring**: After the ISR completes, the saved state is restored, and normal program execution resumes.

## 4. Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)

The **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** is a special function that runs when an interrupt is triggered. It should be short and efficient since it temporarily pauses the rest of the program. Long-running ISRs can cause delays and impact system performance, especially if other interrupts are waiting to be handled.

### Guidelines for Writing ISRs:
- **Keep it Short**: ISRs should only perform the necessary action to handle the interrupt, like setting a flag or reading a value. Lengthy processing should be deferred to the main program.
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Avoid relying on other tasks or functions within the ISR.
- **Prioritize Efficiency**: Since ISRs block normal execution, they must be optimized for speed.
- **Use Volatile Variables**: Any variables shared between the ISR and the main program should be declared as `volatile` to prevent the compiler from optimizing them away.

## 5. Interrupt Prioritization and Nesting

In many microcontroller systems, interrupts can be assigned different priority levels. This allows the microcontroller to handle the most critical events first, even if other interrupts are pending. For example, a high-priority interrupt, such as a system fault, can preempt lower-priority interrupts.

### Interrupt Nesting
Some microcontrollers support **interrupt nesting**, where a higher-priority interrupt can interrupt a lower-priority ISR that is currently being executed. This enables the system to respond to critical events without delay, even during other interrupt processing.

## 6. Using Interrupts in Real-Time Systems

Interrupts are a core component in real-time systems, where responsiveness to events is crucial. They enable systems to handle tasks that require immediate attention without introducing delays or inefficiencies caused by polling.

In real-time applications, interrupts are often used for:
- **Sensor Data Acquisition**: Reading data from sensors immediately when an event is detected (e.g., temperature thresholds).
- **Timer-Based Events**: Triggering periodic tasks like motor control, LED blinking, or data sampling.
- **Communication**: Receiving data from UART, SPI, or I2C without polling, allowing efficient data transfer.

## 7. Challenges and Considerations with Interrupts

While interrupts are powerful tools for managing events, there are several challenges and best practices to consider:

### Interrupt Latency
**Interrupt latency** refers to the time between the interrupt event occurring and the start of the ISR execution. High latency can affect the system’s ability to respond quickly to critical events, especially in time-sensitive applications.

Factors influencing interrupt latency include:
- The number of higher-priority interrupts.
- The time spent in other ISRs.
- The microcontroller’s clock speed and architecture.

### Interrupt Overload
If too many interrupts are triggered in quick succession, the system may become overloaded, spending all its time handling ISRs and neglecting the main program. This situation is known as **interrupt overload** or **interrupt storm**, and it can degrade system performance.

### Interrupt Synchronization
When interrupts modify shared resources, synchronization is necessary to avoid data corruption or race conditions. Semaphores, mutexes, or disabling interrupts temporarily can be used to ensure that shared resources are accessed safely.

## 8. Interrupts and FreeRTOS

In systems using **FreeRTOS**, interrupts play an essential role in managing real-time tasks. FreeRTOS allows tasks to be notified by ISRs, and higher-priority interrupts can wake up tasks that need immediate attention. However, special care must be taken when interacting with FreeRTOS from an ISR, as certain functions (like memory allocation) cannot be called directly from an interrupt context.

### Key Concepts:
- **Task Notifications**: ISRs can notify tasks to trigger specific actions, like starting data processing when an interrupt occurs.
- **Semaphore Usage**: ISRs can use semaphores to signal tasks when an interrupt event is handled, ensuring safe synchronization between the ISR and tasks.

## 9. Conclusion

Interrupts are an essential feature in embedded systems, enabling real-time responsiveness to external and internal events. By understanding how interrupts work, how to design efficient ISRs, and how to manage interrupt priorities, you can create systems that are both responsive and resource-efficient. Proper use of interrupts, combined with FreeRTOS or other RTOSs, allows for the development of sophisticated embedded applications that handle real-time requirements with ease.
